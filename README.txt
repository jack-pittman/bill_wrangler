BILL WRANGLER: A BRIEF GUIDE

Bill Wrangler is an internal tool designed to 
automate the retreival of AWS billing data, 
first "wrangling" the data from Cost Explorer, 
then dropping it into a Google Sheet. 

The dev team, (me) hopes that this simple 
application adds true value to the Cognosos 
corporation, and upholds the ancient wisdom, 
"Never spend 6 minutes doing something by hand 
when you can spend 6 hours failing to automate it."

  2. You may see a ModuleNotFoundError when you try to 
     run. that means you haven't activated the virtual 
     environment. To activate the virtual environment, 
     type 'source sheets/bin/activate.'
